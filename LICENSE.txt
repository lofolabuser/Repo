PRICING
Prices for products on Lofo Lab are described on our Site and incorporated into these Terms by reference.  Prices and products may change at Lofo Lab's discretion.


PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNT
(a) Subscription Fee.  By subscribing to a Professional Account, you agree to pay the subscription fee identified at the time you subscribe. Your subscription will remain in effect from the date on which you subscribe until the end of the subscription period you have selected.  Your subscription will renew automatically at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel it before the end of your current subscription period.  Subscription “periods” may be either month to month or for longer periods of time.

We reserve the right at any time to change the subscription fee for the Professional Account. In no event will you be charged any new or different fee unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such fee.  If you do not consent to such fee, however, you will no longer receive the Professional Account.

(b) Refund Policy.  Except as described below, we will not refund any fees paid for subscription to a Professional Account. It is your responsibility to determine if the Professional Account meets your needs before you subscribe.

(c) Cancellation.  You may cancel your subscription for a Professional Account at any time. If you do cancel, you will not receive a refund of your subscription fee for the current subscription period (but you will continue to have access to the Professional Account for the remainder of your subscription period). If you would like to renew your subscription after cancellation, you will need to subscribe again after the original expiration date of your subscription.

(d) Termination of Professional Account.  We may elect, in our sole discretion, to terminate the Professional Account Service. If we do, we will refund to you a pro rata portion (based on the time remaining in your subscription period) of your subscription fee for the period in which such termination occurs. The foregoing applies only to circumstances in which we terminate the Professional Account Service for all of our registered members and shall not entitle you to a refund if we terminate your individual access to the Professional Account Service because you have failed to comply with any of these Terms.
