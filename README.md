THIS FILE'S CONTENT:
As suggested by https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/02wi/homework/hw5/good-readmes.html.
Brief or no discussion of concepts which were stated in lecture (eg, how an AVL tree does its rotations).
Succinct discussion of important design issues that were faced, the solution that was decided upon, as well as the rationale behind the decision.
For the Shakespeare/Bacon or extra credit analyses, it was important to state:
    - The problem/question they were answering,
    - Any relevant data that they collected,
    - An answer to the stated question, which is justified by the collected data.

The website are expected to contain the following tools, for your environment to be ready:
- HTML5 Boilerplate (See Documentation here: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/5.3.0/dist/doc/TOC.md)
- bootstrap
- jQuery
- Modernizr
- Node.js capabilities for both the server and client sides.
- Angular 2
Also, please take note that bootstrap dropped supports for IE7. You will also be required to install WinLess (http://winless.org) for compiling LESS files on Windows. For unix users, please "npm install -g less", assuming you have installed Node.js.
